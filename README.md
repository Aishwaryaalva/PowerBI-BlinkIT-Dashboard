# ðŸ“ŠBlinkIT Sales And Analysis Dashboard
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze BlinkITâ€™s sales and business performance. The dashboard offers a detailed view of key metrics such as total sales, profit, number of orders, top-performing products, regional contributions, and customer purchasing trends. A dataset of 8,524 rows was cleaned, transformed, and modeled using Power Query and DAX, enabling meaningful and actionable insights. The visualizations include line charts for sales trends, bar charts for product performance, pie charts for category-wise distribution, maps for regional analysis, and KPI cards for quick business snapshots.

The analysis uncovers patterns in customer behavior (such as weekend shopping peaks), regional performance variations, and profitability trends, thereby supporting data-driven decision-making. In the future, this project can be extended with real-time data integration, SQL-based pipelines, and predictive analytics using machine learning to forecast demand, optimize inventory, and provide deeper business intelligence.
